Summary:

This project aims to implement a deep learning-based solution for classifying brain tumors into three categories: meningioma, glioma, and pituitary tumors, using a dataset of medical images. The implementation will begin with preprocessing the image data, including scaling, resizing, and one-hot encoding to ensure the images are formatted appropriately for model training. The core of the project involves training three different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)—VGG-16, Inception, and ResNet—each known for their strengths in image classification tasks. These models will be trained on the dataset using the categorical cross-entropy loss function, which helps in multi-class classification, and the Adam optimizer, which adjusts the model weights to improve accuracy. After training, the models will be evaluated using key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix analysis. The evaluation will help identify the best-performing model for this task and provide insights into how well each model can distinguish between the different tumor types. The primary application of this deep learning model is in the medical field, where it can assist healthcare professionals by providing early, reliable brain tumor diagnoses based on medical images, potentially improving treatment planning and patient outcomes. This approach could be integrated into diagnostic systems, helping doctors identify the specific type of brain tumor, which is crucial for determining the most effective treatment options.
